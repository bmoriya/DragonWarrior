ABOUT
=====

This is a clone of Dragon Warrior for the NES done in Python for Linux.

I also started one in C, as a different user, but no longer have the email 
address associated with that account so I am abandoning it.

REQUIREMENTS
============

Python 2.x, Pygame 1.9, and I think that's it. I haven't tested on Windows yet
but it should work. I have been developing it on xubuntu 11.04 so I know it 
runs on Linux.

INSTRUCTIONS
============

Run it from the command line using the interpreter. If you are in the 
DragonWarrior directory type:
python src/game.py

All you can do right now is scroll around the first map.
